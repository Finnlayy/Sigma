## 2026-08-29 - /api/logs re-scanned trades four times
**Learning:** `GET /api/logs` is polled every 5–8s (`SigmaTerminal`, `legacyPanels`) and each helper (`_paper_balances`, `_build_metrics`, `_strategy_pnl`, plus the handler) independently called `store.trades(status="closed")`. One poll materialized up to ~36k trade rows. At 8k trades that was ~110 ms vs ~35 ms for a single scan (~3×, ~75 ms/poll).
**Action:** On dashboard/poll endpoints, fetch the closed-trade snapshot once and pass it down. Do not assume each helper should own its own `trades()` call.

## 2026-08-29 - DuckDB ART indexes on trades were unused
**Learning:** `CREATE INDEX ON trades(status, entry_time)` and `(strategy_id, status, entry_time)` did **not** change the plan: DuckDB still chose `SEQ_SCAN` for `WHERE status='closed' ORDER BY entry_time DESC` and for `strategy_id + status` filters (EXPLAIN, 200–8k rows). Columnar scan beat ART; indexes would only add write cost on every `upsert_trade`.
**Action:** Do not add DuckDB secondary indexes without an EXPLAIN that shows INDEX_SCAN. Prefer fewer queries / SQL aggregates over speculative ART indexes.

## 2026-08-29 - empty execution_mode vs SQL COALESCE
**Learning:** Python `(execution_mode or "paper")` treats `""` as paper. SQL `COALESCE(execution_mode, 'paper')` does **not** — empty string is not NULL, so a SUM filter would drop those rows. Use `COALESCE(NULLIF(execution_mode, ''), 'paper')`.
**Action:** When replacing a Python `x or default` scan with SQL, match empty-string and NULL, not just NULL.

## 2026-08-30 - COALESCE default must be literal 'paper', not the filter bind
**Learning:** `COALESCE(NULLIF(mode,''), ?) = ?` with both binds set to `"live"` treats `""` as live. Python `(x or "paper") == "live"` is False for empty string. Yesterday's `sum_closed_pnl` only queried `"paper"` so the bug was latent; `count_closed_trades("live")` exposed it.
**Action:** Hardcode the Python default (`'paper'`) inside COALESCE, then compare to the bind param. Never use the filter value as the NULLIF/COALESCE fallback. Always assert both the default mode and a non-default mode in SQL-parity tests.
