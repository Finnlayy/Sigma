## 2026-08-30 - /api/logs snapshot itself was the remaining cost
**Learning:** After collapsing 4× `trades()` into one 10k-row scan (~39 ms @ 8k), the poll still spent that time building Python dicts. Metrics, paper USD, and `strategyPnL` only need COUNT/SUM/GROUP BY; the UI order list needs 80 rows. SQL aggregates + `LIMIT 80` is ~4 ms (~9×). Sharing a fat snapshot is not enough when the snapshot is unused as rows.
**Action:** On dashboard/poll endpoints, ask whether the JSON needs trade row dicts at all. Prefer DuckDB aggregates (`COALESCE(NULLIF(execution_mode,''),'paper')`) and a tiny recent-row fetch over "scan once and pass down".

## 2026-08-29 - /api/logs re-scanned trades four times
**Learning:** `GET /api/logs` is polled every 5–8s (`SigmaTerminal`, `legacyPanels`) and each helper (`_paper_balances`, `_build_metrics`, `_strategy_pnl`, plus the handler) independently called `store.trades(status="closed")`. One poll materialized up to ~36k trade rows. At 8k trades that was ~110 ms vs ~35 ms for a single scan (~3×, ~75 ms/poll).
**Action:** On dashboard/poll endpoints, fetch the closed-trade snapshot once and pass it down. Do not assume each helper should own its own `trades()` call.

## 2026-08-29 - DuckDB ART indexes on trades were unused
**Learning:** `CREATE INDEX ON trades(status, entry_time)` and `(strategy_id, status, entry_time)` did **not** change the plan: DuckDB still chose `SEQ_SCAN` for `WHERE status='closed' ORDER BY entry_time DESC` and for `strategy_id + status` filters (EXPLAIN, 200–8k rows). Columnar scan beat ART; indexes would only add write cost on every `upsert_trade`.
**Action:** Do not add DuckDB secondary indexes without an EXPLAIN that shows INDEX_SCAN. Prefer fewer queries / SQL aggregates over speculative ART indexes.

## 2026-08-29 - empty execution_mode vs SQL COALESCE
**Learning:** Python `(execution_mode or "paper")` treats `""` as paper. SQL `COALESCE(execution_mode, 'paper')` does **not** — empty string is not NULL, so a SUM filter would drop those rows. Use `COALESCE(NULLIF(execution_mode, ''), 'paper')`.
**Action:** When replacing a Python `x or default` scan with SQL, match empty-string and NULL, not just NULL.
