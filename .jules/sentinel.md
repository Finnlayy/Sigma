## 2026-09-10 - [DOM-based XSS Prevention via External Payload URLs]
**Vulnerability:** External URLs passed directly from API payloads into DOM sinks (e.g. href, src) without protocol validation, risking stored XSS (e.g. javascript:...).
**Learning:** React escapes text children by default, but injecting unvalidated strings into `href` or `src` attributes bypasses this protection, allowing execution of malicious protocols.
**Prevention:** Always validate protocols of any dynamically sourced URLs before setting them on DOM nodes. Create and utilize a central `sanitizeUrl` helper allowing only safe protocols (http/https/ftp/mailto).
